## Color Game

My game ~~generates random hex codes~~ chooses random colors from Material-UI's color options and renders 4 circles.

Each time the player clicks a circle, the circles shuffle in a random order.

When all the circles are clicked, you move up a level.

If you mess up, you move down a level.
